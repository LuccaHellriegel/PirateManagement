# PirateManagement

An app for pirates to manage their treasure hunts and for crews to apply to hunt those treasures.
Arrrr!

A playground to take a simple-but-not-too-simple (mostly) backend-API use case and re-implement it in mutliple languages, styles, frameworks.
Considered to be always WIP.

## Implementations

### Backend

- Java/Spring (abstract)
- Java/Spring (simple)
- Go/Gin (simple)

### Frontend

- TS/React
